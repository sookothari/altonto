# Risk Measures Ontology Documentation

## Overview
The Risk Measures ontology provides a comprehensive framework for modeling and measuring risks in private markets investments.

## Class Hierarchy

### RiskMeasure
Base class for all risk measurements.

#### Investment Risk
1. Concentration Risk
   - Sector concentration
   - Geographic concentration
   - Single investment exposure

2. Value at Risk
   - Confidence levels
   - Time horizons
   - Historical vs. parametric

#### Liquidity Risk
1. Unfunded Commitment Risk
   - Commitment coverage ratio
   - Call probability
   - Buffer requirements

2. Exit Risk
   - Hold period analysis
   - Market condition impact
   - Exit route probability

#### Operational Risk
1. Process Risk
   - Workflow efficiency
   - Control effectiveness
   - Error rates

2. System Risk
   - Technology dependencies
   - Integration points
   - Recovery capabilities

```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Risk Assessment Process
1. Initial Assessment
   ```sparql
   # Create new risk assessment
   INSERT DATA {
       ex:RiskAssessment2024Q1 a pm:RiskAssessment ;
           pm:assessmentDate "2024-02-16"^^xsd:date ;
           pm:hasRiskMeasure ex:ConcentrationRisk1 .
   }
   ```

2. Monitoring
   ```sparql
   # Monitor risk trends
   SELECT ?assessment ?score ?date
   WHERE {
       ?assessment a pm:RiskAssessment ;
           pm:hasRiskMeasure ?measure .
       ?measure pm:riskScore ?score ;
           pm:assessmentDate ?date .
   }
   ORDER BY DESC(?date)
   ```

### Risk Limits and Thresholds
1. Limit Definition
   ```owl
   # Risk Limit
   Class: RiskLimit
       Properties:
           - limitValue
           - warningThreshold
           - breachThreshold
   ```

2. Monitoring
   ```sparql
   # Check limit breaches
   SELECT ?measure ?score ?limit
   WHERE {
       ?measure a pm:RiskMeasure ;
           pm:riskScore ?score .
       ?limit a pm:RiskLimit ;
           pm:limitValue ?maxValue .
       FILTER(?score > ?maxValue)
   }
   ```

## Integration Points

### Performance Integration
1. Risk-Adjusted Returns
   ```owl
   # Risk-Adjusted Metric
   Class: RiskAdjustedMetric
       SubClassOf: PerformanceMetric
       Properties:
           - hasRiskMeasure
           - adjustmentFactor
   ```

2. Attribution Analysis
   - Risk contribution
   - Performance attribution
   - Factor analysis

### Portfolio Management
1. Risk Aggregation
   - Portfolio level
   - Fund level
   - Investment level

2. Exposure Analysis
   - Direct exposure
   - Indirect exposure
   - Look-through analysis

## Best Practices

### Risk Assessment
1. Frequency
